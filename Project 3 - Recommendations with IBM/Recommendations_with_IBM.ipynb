The number of common users between the training data set and the testing data set is insuificient (related to cold start problem) that SVD (and its related metics) is not recommended to predict the testing data set; rather, aforementioned knowledge-based or content-based methods is more fecilitous for such cold start situation.\n","\n","2. Much more indicators/features than sorely interaction may help increasing the model performance. We can collect more features. That is, multifarious types of interaction indicators include but not limited to \"attitude toward articles\" (a article rating system on the frond-end page), \"reading time\" (tracking the time that users consume), or cover/over attention on the article (mouse tracking, scroll tracking, or even eye tracking). We can expect these features can help model (such as estimation of user-user similarity) than only by user-article interaction.   \n","\n","3. We can conduct A/B testing to our recommendation systems to determine \"which model performs better so that we should take it as our recommendation system\". In detail, we divide group of users into two groups by random assignment. The first group is recommended articles by SVD method and the second group is recommended articles by user-user based collobrative filtering method. In the end, we can find which method performs well and utilize it as our model underlying our recommendation system.

These tasks are beyond what is required for this project.  However, from what you learned in the lessons, you certainly capable of taking these tasks on to improve upon your work here!\n","\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","> Congratulations!  You have reached the end of the Recommendations with IBM project! \n","\n","> **Tip**: Once you are satisfied with your work here, check over your report to make sure that it is satisfies all the areas of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2322/view).

To do that, run the code cell below. If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left).\n","\n","> Alternatively, you can download this report as .html via the **File** > **Download as** submenu, and then manually upload it into the workspace directory by clicking on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left, then using the Upload button.\n","\n","> Once you've done this, you can submit your project by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button in the lower right here.
